Branch: main

Files Ready:
✓ railway.json (Railway configuration)
✓ start.sh (Startup script with error handling)
✓ runtime.txt (Python 3.11)
✓ requirements.txt (All dependencies)
✓ Procfile (Alternative start command)

Security Secrets Generated:
✓ SECRET_KEY=8d440925489b66132ade62b809120bb0ffc98d02e3bab9dfcd850c3d67b9f088

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IN RAILWAY
================================================================================

1. Add PostgreSQL Database
   Dashboard → New → Database → PostgreSQL

2. Set Environment Variables (9 total)
   Service → Variables → New Variable

   Copy these exactly:

   ENVIRONMENT=production
   SECRET_KEY=8d440925489b66132ade62b809120bb0ffc98d02e3bab9dfcd850c3d67b9f088
   CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=Z_iT0VGUhBuUOhR-NiPlLQC6vntAa6FxN31qTLbRwks=
   ALGORITHM=HS256
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
   CORS_ORIGINS=https://YOUR-URL.up.railway.app
   BASE_URL=https://YOUR-URL.up.railway.app
   ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=True
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO

3. Get Your Railway URL
   Settings → Domains → Generate Domain
   Use this URL for CORS_ORIGINS and BASE_URL above

4. Watch Deployment
   Deployments → Click latest → See logs

================================================================================
WHAT I CAN DO FROM HERE
================================================================================

✓ Push code changes to GitHub
✓ Generate new security secrets
✓ Update configuration files
✓ Analyze error logs
✓ Provide troubleshooting steps
✓ Test your deployed URL
✓ Guide you through fixes
✓ Monitor deployment status (via your updates)

✗ Cannot access Railway API (workspace token doesn't work with GraphQL)
✗ Cannot set environment variables directly (need Railway UI)
✗ Cannot view logs directly (need you to share them)

================================================================================
QUICK DEPLOYMENT NOW
================================================================================

Say: "deploy now"

I will:
1. Commit any changes
2. Push to GitHub (pranab112/test)
3. Railway auto-deploys

You:
1. Watch Railway dashboard
2. Copy deployment logs
3. Send them to me
4. I'll analyze and fix if needed

================================================================================
TESTING YOUR DEPLOYMENT
================================================================================

Once deployed, share your Railway URL and I'll test:

✓ /health → Should return {"status":"healthy"}
✓ /client → Should load client dashboard
✓ /player → Should load player dashboard
✓ /admin → Should load admin dashboard

I'll tell you exactly what's working and what's not.

================================================================================
COMMON ISSUES I CAN FIX
================================================================================

"Build failed - pip not found"
   → Already fixed in latest code
   → Say "deploy now" to push fix

"ValidationError: SECRET_KEY required"
   → Need to add environment variables
   → Say "fix environment" for exact values

"CORS_ORIGINS must be set"
   → Need to add CORS_ORIGINS variable
   → Say "fix environment" for instructions

"Could not connect to database"
   → PostgreSQL not added
   → Or not linked to service
   → I'll guide you through linking

"Migration failed"
   → start.sh has retry logic
   → May need to check DATABASE_URL
   → Say "troubleshoot migration"

================================================================================
